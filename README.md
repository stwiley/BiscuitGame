# BiscuitGame
This was an entry for the GMTK Game Jam 2020. The theme was "Out of Control," so we opted to make a short game where you control a "chaos oven"
to make a biscuit using various levers, dials and buttons. The catch is that while your biscuit is generated based on your inputs, you don't
know what your inputs are actually doing, hence being "out of control."
